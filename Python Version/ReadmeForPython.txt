Make sure you have Pytesseract and pillow modules installed. 
(To install modules, just open CMD and type 'pip install module_name')
You will also need to install an extra package called tesserect externally from tesseract-ocr.github.io and put that tesseract folder inside the tesseract folder. If the program can't find the tesseract module, then check the path code in line 
I hope this version will also work fine in other systems. My current python version 3.10 (when I made this).
