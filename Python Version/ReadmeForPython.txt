For Python users, you just have to download the files from the Python Version folder, then just double 
click on the Textemage.py to open the program. 
Make sure you have Pytesseract and pillow module installed. 
(To install modules, just open CMD and type 'pip install module_name')
You will also need to install an extra package called tesserect externally from tesseract-ocr.github.io and put that tesseract folder inside this folder.
I hope this version will also work fine in other systems. My current python version 3.10 (when I made this).
